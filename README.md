# Ghalactic branding assets

This repo automatically produces a large variety of useful branding assets from
a small set of input assets.

[Download the latest branding assets](https://github.com/ghalactic/branding/releases/latest/download/ghalactic.branding.zip)

## Usage

To make updates to the branding assets, update the input assets/config in the
`src` directory, and push a new Git tag with a brief changelog. An automated
workflow will take care of the rest.

To test your changes, simply run `make`, and check the output in the
`artifacts/dist` directory.
